 Pairing w/ Brandong 9/11/25

 try-catch has a very specific meaning... this application is busted
 errors are not meant to be expected results even if those results are not desirable
 expected results from a bad client request should not be errors
 client errors should be handled with control flow, don't think of try catch as control flow
 using try catch as control flow is asking for trouble, it should be used to handle disaster scenario
