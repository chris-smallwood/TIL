## Pairing w/ Brandon

Don't write code on day 1 for year 10. Write code on day 1 that is flexible for year 10, but implements day 1.

Think while reading/coding: which of these versions of the code would I want to change?

Writing an API while collaborting with frontend:
- don't write objects just for the sake of writing objects, make sure htey have clear meaning in your domain
- think on it just enough to get it done
- hard code inputs and outputs

EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE DEPLOYED TO PROD FROM THE BEGINNING
- Could deploy to inspections namespace (breaking rules)
- could open a PR for terraform for SRE to create a new microservice
- every day we are not doing that, there is risk
