- checkout tsconfig.json
- parse vs safeParsej
- types vs interfaces

- TS Result ```ts-resuls-es``` for implementing step result functionality

- Functional coding
  - define functions as constants that are functions instaed of directly as functions
  - defining functions as higher order, 1st class, functions are just data you can hand around

- Factory pattern
  - implement when deciding what to do
  - function code is how to do it, returning function
 
- use Case (Add Route), the factory that returns the use case is called a composition root

- Goal: Each step so simple that it almost doesn't make sense to test
